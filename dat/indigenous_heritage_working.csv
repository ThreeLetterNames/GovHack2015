16,Parliament Hill (approximate location),+ACI-In 1835, when the first Europeans arrived, the future site of Parliament House, on the hill later known as the Eastern, or Parliament, Hill, was a gum and wattle forest. This site was a traditional Kulin meeting place and favoured for inter+AC0-clan gatherings and ceremonial purposes, including corroborees. When Aboriginal clans gathered together, dancing displays welcomed visitors and celebrated special events. There exists an eyewitness account of a corroboree in 1836, on the site of Parliament House. The writer of the Chronicles of Early Melbourne, +ACIAIg-Garryowen+ACIAIg-, or Edmund Finn, describes a corroboree that occurred on Parliament Hill, on 21st August, 1836, just 14 months after Batman rowed up the Yarra to the site now occupied by the central business district of Melbourne. Garryowen, who arrived in Australia in 1841, was not an eyewitness to this corroboree, but his unnamed source might be the surveyor Robert Russell whom he cites as one of his principal authorities for the events of 1836.

This event draws together a number of interesting strands. It occurred very early in the history of European settlement and appears to be an eyewitness account+ADs- possibly the first time Europeans had seen a corroboree.  The location was one traditionally used for corroborees and may have been considered a special place of power. The corroboree may have been intended as a welcome to the new people and/or as a celebration of their important man. It can be argued that it was a gift or a great honour for this ceremony to have been performed in conjunction with a European celebration.+ACI-,+ACI-Parliament Hill, which was a traditional Kulin meeting place and favoured for inter+AC0-clan gatherings and ceremonial purposes, is recorded as the site of a corroboree on 21st August, 1836, just 14 months after Batman rowed up the Yarra to the site now occupied by the central business district of Melbourne.+ACI-,,East Melbourne,Corroboree Location,Corroboree,1836,1836,Dancing+ADs- Singing+ADs- Ceremony+ADs- Business,Pre+AC0-contact+ADs- Early colonial,None Recorded,None Recorded,None Recorded,+ACI-Presland, G 1985, Aboriginal Melbourne: The Lost Land of the Kulin People, Harriland Press, Forest Hill+ADs- Parliament of Victoria 2010, Traditional Owners and the site of Parliament Hill, Parliament of Victoria+ACI-,Book+ADs- Web,http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/about/the+AC0-history+AC0-of+AC0-parliament/traditional+AC0-owners+AC0-and+AC0-site+AC0-of+AC0-parliament+AC0-house,,,,,,None Recorded,,2F K2,None Recorded,None Recoded,,Intangible Associations+ADs- Suspected Archaeological Deposits,,+AC0-37.8154085,144.9813591

In 1836 the first Melbourne settlers were buried here and it became known as Burial Hill. The child William Goodman was the first white person to be buried here, followed by the pastoralistt Charles Franks and his shepherd, who were killed by Aboriginal people using tomahawks. The Pioneer Monument was erected over thirty years later in memory of these first settlers.

53,Another View Walking Trail 5 +AC0- Melbourne Remand Centre (Melbourne Assessment Prison),+ACI-Since the beginning of European occupation, the labour of Aboriginal men and women was often exploited to contribute to the development of the Australian industry and the building of this nation. From 1798 Aboriginal women along the southern Victorian coast were kidnapped by sealers and taken to the islands in the Bass Strait. Here they worked long hours in the whaling industry +AC0- catching, skinning seals and rendering the fat. In the mid 1800s the Immigration Barracks was located on this site. It housed Women from the United Kingdom who had come to Australia in response to advertisements promising a better life in the 'new' country. Treatment in the Barracks was strict while the women waited for work opportunities as domestic servants. Employers complained that the women were choosy in selecting jobs and often stayed in the Barracks in preference to a life of hardship in the bush and so Aboriginal girls were also sent to outstations to work for European couples for little or no remuneration. The purpose was to assimilate the girls into European culture and to breed out the Aborigine, in the hope that they would lead a 'better life'. Students from the Victorian College of Arts, Lucy Tancredi, Kirsten Lacy and Lorrae Head have created two mosaic pieces in consultation with residents from the Galiamble men's Recovery Centre. The work is a personal response from the students to the broad issues of the 'Another View' Walking Trail project.  +ACI-,Melbourne Remand Centre contains artwork describing the Whaling Trade in Southern Victoria and is on the site of the Immigration Barracks from which Aboriginal girls were sent to work on outstations.,,,Gaol,,,,,19th century+ADs- 20th century,None Recorded,None Recorded,None Recorded,+ACI-Ray Thomas, Megan Evans and Robert Mate Mate, Another View Walking Trail: Pathway of the Rainbow Serpent,City of Melbourne, Melbourne+ACI-,Pamphlet/Brochure,,,No Specific,,Lucy Tancredi+ADs- Kirsten Lacy+ADs- Lorrae Head,Female,None Recorded,,,None Recorded,None Recoded,Melbourne Remand Centre,Structure+ADs- Intangible Associations+ADs- Art Work,,+ACM-VALUE+ACE-,+ACM-VALUE+ACE-
54,Another View Walking Trail 6 +AC0- Corner Collins +ACY- Spencer Streets ,+ACI-This area was once covered with she+AC0-oaks and was traditionally the borderline between the Woiworung and the Bunurong tribe of the Kulin Nation. Members of the Kulin nation were governed by two special totems, Bunjil the Eaglehawk and Waang the Crow. Each tribe also had their own insignia. The Woiworung tribe were known as the coograbulluk +AC0- the possum skinned people, and the Bunurong tribe were the boonatallung +AC0- the kangaroo skinned people. Both tribes wore possum skinned cloaks and would mark their totems on the inside of their cloaks. The cloaks were highly valued because of the work put into making them. John Batman built his house in this vicinity, now the Southern Cross Railway station and yards. Batman is known as one of the pioneers of settlement at Port Phillip. He sailed from Tasmania with the purpose of acquiring land in the Port Phillip region. On the 6 June 1835 he signed the Treaty of Doutta Galla and Geellong with the Ngurungetti Head men of the Watharaung tribe. In return for land the Aboriginal people recieved blankets, knives, tomahawks, looking+AC0-glasses, scissors, handkerchiefs, clothing and flour. One purpose of the treaty was to persuade the governments in Sydney and London that Batman would treat the Local Aboriginal people fairly, so that the new settlement initiated by independent landowners should be sanctioned. After signing the treaty Batman sailed back to Tasmania and left written authority witht he holding party +ACIAIg-to put off any person or persons that may tresspass on the land i have purchased from the natives+ACIAIg-. Next year the British Government disallowed the purchase, holding that the land was not occupied by a settled people and was therefore terra nullius (belonging to no+AC0-one)+ADs- the Aboriginal people therefore had no title to it and it belonged to the Crown. At the same time, Batman had not realised that according to Aboriginal Traditions, the tribes were merely custodians of the land and could not sell it.

In March 1838 the settlement's first race meeting was held over two days on a course not far away, marked out near the present Spencer Street Station (now Southern Cross Station). It was a primitive affair with two drays lashed together to make the grandstand. After the 1839 race, at a meeting held in Fawkners nearby hotel in Market Street, it was decided to move the race to a better site +AC0- at Flemington, later the site of the VRC racecourse and the famous Melbourne Cup. Many years later in 1876, a thriteen year old Aboriginal schoolboy called Peter substituted for jockey Tommy Hales in the Melbourne Cup and rode the winner, 'Briseis' a three year old black filly. Peter lived with his adopted father Jim Wilson, owner of the St. Albans Stud Farm near Geelong, and he became the youngest person to win a national turf event.

56,Another View Walking Trail 9 +AC0- Yarra Footbridge,+ACI-Near the Flinders Street Railway Station water from the eummemmering (creek) flows from under Elizabeth St and enters the Birrarang (Yarra River). It is an old Aboriginal belief that when a creek flows into a river the meeting place of the waters is the Kameruka (camp of spirit children) waiting to be reborn as human beings. The Yarra River that flows through Melbourne was infact misnamed at the time of white settlement by surveyor John Heldar Wedge who was a member of Batman's party. In August 1835, he was exploring the Bellarine peninsula and the coast as far as cape addis witht he intention of finding a suitable place to establish a township. Accompanying him were two Aboriginal youths from the Wauthaurung tribe. Wedge's account is as follows: +ACIAIg-On arriving in site fot he river, the two natives who were with me pointed to the river and called out 'Yarra', 'Yarra', which at the time i imagined to be it's name. But I afterwards learnt that the words were what they used to designate a waterfall, as they later gave the same designation to a small fall in the Werribee river, as we crossed it on our way back to Indented Head+ACIAIg-. Birrarang means 'river of mists', and in the Wauthaurung language 'Yarra' means 'falling or free flowing'.

57,Another View Walking Trail 10 +AC0- Princes Bridge,+ACI-Prior to white settlement this was the old river crossing pace of bapora where an Aboriginal named Wharrimee was responsible for ferrying people across the river. In the mid 1840's when the Princes Bridge was under construction, William Thomas the Protector of Aborigines at Narre Narre Warren Mission and a group of Aboriginals were watching a brick maker at work. Billy Lonsdale, a Westernport Aboriginal, seeing the brick maker smoothing the clay in the mould commented that the action reminded him of the Kulin creation story. The story as interpreted by William Thomas in his recording is as follows. Bunjil the Eagle created two males figures out of clay. He cut three large sheets of bark and mixed the clay in one and placed the soft mixture on the two other sheets. He shaped the clay into two male figures starting at the feet, and when he had completed them he performed a ritual dance around the figures. He took some stringy bark from the tree and made straight and curly hair which he placed on the head of each figure. Again he danced around the figures. he called the straight hair figure Berrok Boorn and the curly hair Kookin Berrook. He then lay upon each of the figures and breathed into their nostrils, mouth and navel. The figures stirred and he danced around them for a third time, giving them speech and movement. Bunjil had created the first Kulin+AC0-man. Bunjils sister Pallyon the Bat created woman Ba Goruk from the waters of the Birrarang (Yarra River).

The loss of certain rituals and traidtions, their rebirth and revival and the birth of cultures and rituals from other lands +AC0- a changing landscape that embodies the spirit of the Rainbow Serpent forever.  Produced by the artists and residents at the Galiamble Men's Recovery Centre. The image of Queen Victoria is a self+AC0-assured inspring hope, endurance and compassion in her subjects throughtout the colonies of the British Empire. The four figures recessed beneath her on the monument are allegorical representations of 'wisdom', 'progress', 'history' and 'justice'. Through diaries, journals, paintings and later photography, the early white settlers were avid documentors of the Aboriginal People. But ethnocentrism, or the belief in the superiority of their own culture lay at the base of many of their observations. Records of Aboriginal traditional lifestyle generally stressed how the two cultures differed, and they depicted the Aboriginal way of life as inferior. In interpreting the 'history' of this country, the Europeans did not comprehend the forty thousand years or more of Aboriginal occupation prior to their arrival. Nor did they understand the wisdom of the ceremonial rituals and customs, as they believed the Aboriginals were 'living without the benefit of God'. The rapid rate and spread of land settlement by the Europeans was upheld as 'progress'  by the Colonial Administration in Britain. But to the Aboriginals, who moved in search of food and did not tend crops or animals, the purchase and settlement of land was an unknown concept. At the time of white settlement Aboriginals were made subjects of Great Britain and in the eyes of the law they were equal and 'justice' prevailed. But in reality the treatment was often illegal and unjust. +ACI-,A mosaic that illustrates the Rianbow serpent appearing from underneath the ground. ,,,Contemporary Art+ADs- Walking  Tour+ADs- Memorial,Dreamtime Stories+ADs- Art Display,,,Entertainment,20th century,None Recorded,None Recorded,None Recorded,+ACI-Ray Thomas, Megan Evans and Robert Mate Mate, Another View Walking Trail: Pathway of the Rainbow Serpent,City of Melbourne, Melbourne+ACI-,Pamphlet/Brochure,,,No specific,,Queen Victoria+ADs- Connell+ADs- Henty Brothers,Female+ADs- Male,None Recorded,,,None Recorded,None Recoded,Queen Victoria Gardens,Intangible Associations+ADs- Memorial+ADs- Art Work,Queen Victoria Gardens,+AC0-37.8196429,144.9650616

Robert O'Hara Burke, the leader of the ill+AC0-fated expedition, believed that it was not necessary to employ Aboriignal trackers as was common at the time. In the early stages of the expedition the party journeyed inland and encountered different Aboriginal tribes. Writings from their journals indicate that the leaders viewed Aboriignals with some disdain. Several months later Burke, Wills and King returned to Coopers Creek in South Australia to find thats the depot party had given them up as lost and had left several hours earlier. The three men survived for two months on the supplies left by the depot party and provisions from  the Yuntruwanta tribe.

The accompanying artworks recall the native police. In October 1837, William Lonsdale the first Police Magistrate in Victoria, appointed Charles De Villiers to form a Native Police Corps consisting of Aboriginal troopers. It was intended to select all the troopers from the same clan in order to minimise fighting within the Corps. Billibellary, a headman of the Kulin Nation whose thumb print appears on the treaty of Doutta Galla, believed that the establishment of a Native Police Force would promote understanding and respect between Aboriginals and the new settlers. It was through his  powerful influence that fellow tribal members joined the force. After a year Billibellary became disillusioned and resigned. The initial attempt to form a Native Police Corps was abandoned in Victoria less than two years after it's establishment. A Native Police was eventually established in Victoria in 1842 under Superintendant La Trobe, the local head of the Port Phillip government. Native Police Corps were westablished throughout Australia but by far the most lethal force used against the Aboriginals was the Queensland Native Mounted Police, often conjoled by the European officiers, who were responcible for murder and other atrocities against their own people. The Native Police were still being used in a modified form in the remote parts of  Queensland in the early 20th century. +ACI-,Artworksrecalling the native police. ,,,Memorial+ADs- Walking Tour,Memorium+ADs- Walking,1920,,,20th century,None Recorded,None Recorded,Kulin Nation,+ACI-Ray Thomas, Megan Evans and Robert Mate Mate, Another View Walking Trail: Pathway of the Rainbow Serpent,City of Melbourne, Melbourne+ADs- eMelbourne 2015, King Edward VII Memorial, eMelbourne.+ACI-,Pamphlet/Brochure+ADs- Web,http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM02089b.htm,,Billibellary,male,William Lonsdale+ADs- Charles De Villiers+ADs- Superintendant Charles La Trobe+ADs- A.B.

62,Another View Walking Trail 7 +AC0- National Mutual Plaza (John Pascoe Fawkner and John Batman statues),+ACI-At the time that Batman and Fawkner were establishing themselves on the land that is now known as Melbourne, the British Government and the Anti Slavery Society was intent on civilising that Aboriginals.  Having achieved it's aim of abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire, the Society turned it's attention to the Native Peoples in British colonies. Christianity was seen as the natural means to civilising Aboriginal people. The first mission station was set up in what is now the Botanic Gardens in 1837, and Aboriignal adults were provided with food , and their children with lessons and three meals a day, in return for a few hours labour. The mission failed and was replaced in 1839 by the Aboriginal Protectorate led by George Ausgustus Robinson: his four Assistant Protectors, who were appointed in England had no experience with Australian Aboriginals. Each was allotted a district, and their first duty was to travel throughout their districts and win the confidence of the Aboriginal people in the hope of converting them to Christianity and persuading them not to interfere with the incoming pastoral settlers. Later the Protectors tried to persuade the Aboriginal epople to settle on fixed stations and learn a trade or how to cultivate the soil. But despite the disruption of their traiditonal way of life by the spread of pastoral settlement, the Aboriginal people held strongly to their tradditional patterns of movement and resisted the Protectorate settlements. The Protectorate could not prevent clashes between Aboriginal people and the settlers nor the hostile actions against the Aboriginal people by other governement  officers. By 1848, the Protectorate had clearly failed. It had been given little encouragement by the Government, most settlers bitterly opposed it and the press (except for Fawkner's paper the Port Phillip Patriot) were very critical. The Prevailling view was that the Aboriginal People would soon die out. The traditional Aboriginal pattern work on the poles represents all of the Aboriginal tribes.

63,Statue of Pastor Sir Doug and Lady Gladys Nicholls,+ACI-The statue was unveiled in 2007 in honour of Pastor Doug Nicholls and his wife Gladys Nicholls. Having established a church service that attracted a devoted Aboriginal congregation in 1943, Sir Pastor Douglas Nichols became a field officer for the Aboriginal Advancement League where his commitment to Indigenous welfare made him a natural representative for Aboriginal peple. He was awarded a MBE for his efforts in 1957, in 1972 he became the first Aboriginal person to be knighted and four years later he became the governor of South Australia. Pastor Douglas and Lady Gladys both were born at the Cummeragunga Aboriginal Mission in N.S.W. After the death of Howard Nicholls in 1942  (Lady Gladys' first husband and Pastor Douglas' brother), Lady Gladys married Pastor Douglas. Lady Gladys was a strong person, who was committed to working towards the welfare of the underprivelleged as well as the rights of women. She was a charity worker and fundraiser, and among other achievements became the secretary  of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's council and the Victorian state president in the 1970's. Together the Nicholls were prominent campaigners for Indigenous rights and justice, and this memorial statue, first proposed by the Department of Justice and keenly supported by the Nicholls' family, recognises this. It is the first memorial sculpture in Melbourne dedicated to Aboriginal leaders and its presence strengthens the visibility of Indigenous people and cultural diversity in Melbourne. Sculpture Louis Lauman's intention with these life+AC0-size bronze figures was to create a literal representation of his subjects' place in public life, achknowledging them as a great catalyst for social change. In the bluestone paving below the sculpture, their grandaughter, Ngarra Murray, has etched in the totems of her grandparents, Bigarrumdja the Emu and Waa the Crow with diamond shaped markings. these sysmbols mark the connections that Sir Pastor Douglas and Lady Gladys Nicholls held to their country.

The Sir Douglas and Lady Gladys Nichols Memorial was unveiled in the gardens in December 2007. Sir Douglas and Lady Gladys Nicholls were instrumental in the 1967 referendum campaign to acheive equality for Indigenous Australians. They pressed their case for Aboriginal reconciliation well before reconciliation became the 'popular' view. The couple provided comfort and assistance to many people who were homeless, in need of help or who were disenfranchised. Their work touched on the lives of many and from their humble beginnings at the Gore Street church in fitzroy to Government House in Adelaide, their legacy still lives on today. The memorial was created from a partnership between the Nicholls Family, the City of Melbourne and the Victorian Government (Artists: Louise Lauman, bronze sculpture and Ngarra Murray, ground etching design).  +ACI-,A memorial to Sir Pastor Doug and Lady Gladys Nicholls in honour of the work they accomplished for the Aboriginal people. ,,,Memorial,Celebration+ADs- Memorium,2007,,,21st century,None Recorded,None Recorded,None Recorded,+ACI-City of Melbourne 2015, Celebrate Indigenous Melbourne, City of Melbourne+ACI-,Web,https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/AboutMelbourne/indigenousculture/Documents/Celebrate+AF8-Indigenous+AF8-Melbourne.pdf,,Sir Pastor Doug Nichols+ADs- Lady Gladys Nicholls+ADs- Ngarra Murray,,Louis Lauman,Male,None Recorded,,,None Recorded,None Recoded,Parliament Gardens,Memorial+ADs- Intangible Associations+ADs- Art Work ,Parliament Gardens,+AC0-37.8098873,144.9736066

80,Another View Walking Trail 1 +AC0- Parliament House mosaic,+ACI-The natural environment of this site was a wyebo bunnul (small hill) with underground springs, hence the name Spring Street. This was the site where the Wunrundjeri people performed to the white man for the first time their great national dance Ngargee. The performance was at night and was the Aboriginal contribution to the festivities held earlier in the day to commemmorate the birthday of William IV on 21 August 1836. The mosaic pavement piece is an interpretation of the painting 'Ceremony' (c1890) by William Barak, the last headman of the Woiworung people. The corroboree figures signify this site as a traditional ceremonial ground and meeting place for the people of the Kulin nation. The Rainbow Serpent swallowing its tail symbolises the commencement and completion of the 'Another View' Walking Trail. This is one of several public artworks commissioned for the Another View walking trail, only some of which remain. The trail was created to recognise the shared history of particular city sites. Located outside Parliament House, this paving inlay uses Ceremony, a painting created during the 1890's by Wurundjeri ngungareta (headman) William Barak, to reference the past of this site as a traditional ceremonial ground and a meeting place for the people of the Kulin Nation. +ACI-,An interpretation of the artwork 'Ceremony' by William Barak. ,,,Corroboree Location+ADs- Meeting Place,Art Display,,,Entertainment,Pre+AC0-contact+ADs- 19th Century+ADs- 20th Century,Woiworung ,Wurundjeri, Kulin Nation,+ACI-Ray Thomas, Megan Evans and Robert Mate Mate c. 1994, Another View Walking Trail: Pathway of the Ranbow Serpent, City of Melbourne, Melbourne+ACI-,Pamphlet/Brochure,,,William Barak+ADs- Ray Thomas,Male,William IV,Male,None Recorded,,,Ngungareta+ADs- Wyebo Bunnul+ADs- Ngargee,Headman+ADs- small hill+ADs- national dance,Parliament House,Intangible Associations+ADs- Structure+ADs- Possible Archaeological Deposits+ADs- Art Work,+ACI-Parliament House, Spring Street+ACI-,+AC0-37.8110469,+ACI-,144.973821+ACI-

82,Birrarung Wilam +AFs-Common Ground+AF0- (Sculpture),+ACI-Birrawrung Wilam +AC0- meaning river camp +AC0- is an environmental art project made up of several interrelated elements that celebrate the physical and spiritual connections betwen Indigenous people and place. The philosophy underlying the work is gulpa ngawul, a Yorta Yorta word that most closely translates as 'deep listening'. Accordingly this work by Indigenous artists Vicki Couzens, Lee Darroch and Treahna Hamm honours the traditions of the nations throughtout Victoria, Particularly those of the Wurundjeri and Boonwerrung, on whose country the city and greater Melbourne is located. Birrarung Wilam listens to and commemorates cultural knowledge, stories and practices, revitalising them through the reinterpretation of tradition and the site. The central component of the work is the mound campsite or puulwuurn, supported by an eel pathway, two message sticks, five shields, a group of ancestor stones, interpretative panels, water vessels and an audio installation. The mound campsite is a contemporary recreation of a sitting place, an element central to Aboriginal cultural life+ADs- significant artefacts from Aboriginal groups around Victoria have been interred into the mound. The carved hardwood message sticks stand at the sites eastern and western ends, representing the Wurundjeri/woi wurrung and Boonwerrung people, respectively, and welcoming visitors onto the site in a gesture of reconcilliation. The eel path refers to a primary food source, trapped as they were near the shallow waterfalls that once separated the freshwater river from the salty bay water, not far from this site. The five large metal sheilds along the riverfront stand in complementary opposition to the feminine form of the mound campsite. on the southern side of the ArtPlay building, etched+AC0-metal panels, resembling possum+AC0-skin cloaks, intrepret each element of Birrarung Wilam and are augmented by a sound installation of Indigenous voices. the large, carved ancestor stones are placed to form a semi+AC0-circular performance area, a place where ceremonial and cultural practices can continue to keep the connection to land vibrant. As a Commemorative Place Art Commission, Birrarung Wilam was jointly funded by the City of Melbourne and Victorian government. From 2006 to 2009 Banmirra artists Vicki Couzens and Lee Darroch collaborated with Treahna Hamm to create the Birrarung Wilam Commemorative Place site. The site pays due respect to the Victorian Aboriginal Ancestors who have gone before us and their struggle.  Birrarung Wilam is a place for all of Victoria to come to reflect on the past and move on with the future.+ACI-,An environmental project that celebrates the physical and spiritual links between Aboriginal People and their land. ,,,Contemporary Art+ADs- Aboriginal Named Area,Art Display+ADs- Walking,,,Entertainment,21st century, Woi Wurrung+ADs- Boonwerrung,Wurundjeri+ADs- Yorta Yorta,Kulin Nation,+ACI-City of Melbourne 2015, Aboriginal Outdoor Art Installation+ADs- Banmirra Arts Inc 2015, Birrarung Wilam Commemmorative Place Launch, Banmirra Arts Inc.+ACI-,Internal Document+ADs- Web,http://www.banmirra.org.au/birrarung+AC0-wilam/,,Vicki Couzens+ADs- Lee Darroch+ADs- Treahna Hamm.,Male/Female,,,None Recorded,,,Gulpa Ngawul+ADs- puulwuurn,Deep Listening+ADs- Mound Campsite,,Possible Archaeological Deposits+ADs- Art Work+ADs- Intangible Associations ,Federation Square,+AC0-37.8179789,144.9690576
83,Scar: A Stolen Vision (Sculpture),+ACI-Artistic director Kimba Thompson brought together seven visual artists to create contemporary works that convey tradition and underscore continuity with past practices. Karen Casey, Craig Charles, Glenn Romanis, Maree Clarke, Ray Thomas, Ricardo Idagi and Treahna Hamm worked on 30 pier poles recycled from the docklands project along the Yarra, Carving, burning, painting, and reshaping the poles, the artists impart stories relating to their culture, people and history through their own distictive art practices +AC0- essentially modern forms of tree scarring. Tree scarring refers to the process of the removal of bark for the purpose of making canoes, coolamons and shields, but also for more sacred purposes, such as the marking of a burial site. Scar tree's are significant cultural artefacts that not only mark the historical presence of Aboriginal people in Australia, but are vectors for cultural identity, essential in establishing pre+AC0-contact occupation of an area and important in understanding traditional culture and practices. The installation symbolises a land scape marked by scared trees, articulating the presence of Indigenous people and their connection to country.

86,Reed Vessel (Sculpture),+ACI-Virginia King's Reed Vessel is an 18+AC0-metre+AC0-long vessel form sitting high above a clear, reflective pool in Docklands Park.The maritime nature of the work acknowledges the history of the site and embraces the themes of migration, passage and survival. The area on which it is located was once extensive tidal wetlands, which provided abundant food and spiritual connections to the area for itsa traditional owners. The basket+AC0-like vessel also symbolises a container in which memories are held +AC0- memories of the undeveloped site and it's traditional uses, but also of the ocean journeys that have bought early settlers and later generations of migrants to these shores. Reed Vessel's airy, metaphorical form is achieved through the joining of more than 300 stainless steel pieces into a canoe form. It sits upon a cradlecreated by two louvred water screens, down which water gently flows and through which a fine mist is emitted. The screens are etched with the words of Australian writers and poets, quotations related to the river and the sea, to memory and the passing of time. A pedestrian bridge forms part of the work, taking passers+AC0-by across the pool and through the base of the cradle. Reed Vessel. The vessel becomes a container of memories, a symbol of distant horizons, spiritual journeys, life, hope and survival. The cladding of Reed Vessel alludes not only to the rib and strake of timber and steel ships but also to tidal flow, woven baskets, riverboat and canoe. The skeletal structure can be referenced as leaf or seed pod, source of food and source of life.Water, symbol of life and the spirit, flows from a reservoir beneath the vessel down the louvred panels to the reflection pool and is recycled. Surplus clean water is released into the Yarra River. Mist machines are placed in the reflection pool. A pedestrian footbridge, fabricated from perforated aluminium planks, passes across the wetland and through the support cradle of the vessel. At either end, the footbridge decking of textured planks is inlaid with castings of endangered wetland fauna: frog, lizard and eel.
Materials: Stainless steel, aluminium louvers, recycled plastic decking, aluminium and bronze castings

88,Another View Walking Trail 2 +AC0- Old Melbourne Gaol memorial,+ACI-This area was once part of the colonial place of suffering known as Gallows Hill. The first people to be executed by public hanging in Melbourne, on 20 January 1842, were two Tasmanian Aboriginals named Maulboyhenner (Jack) and Tunnerminnerwait  (Robert). Several thousand people in Melbourne flocked to witness the spectacle of the execution. In 1839 George Augustus Robinson had been appointed the Chief Protector of Aborigines in Victoria. He bought with him a groupd of Tasmanian Aboriginals who would act as go+AC0-betweens to persuade the Aborginals of Victoria to move onto settlements. Maulboyhenner and Tunnerminnerwait were members of this group, and had accompanied Robinson in Tasmania where he had been instrumental in removing the remaining Tasmanian Aboriginals from their land onto Flinders Island in the Bass Strait. Whilst in Victoria, Maulboyhenner and Tunnerminnerwait left Robinson and joined up with a group of Aboriginals from Westernport.  They were skilled in the use of firearms and committed numerous attacks. Maulboyhenner and Tunnerminnerwait were arrested by the Aboriginal Police Corps and charged with the murder of two whalers at Western Port. Metal poles with screenprinted images of the two Tasmanian Aboriginal men are reproduced from watercolours by Thomas Bock painted three years before in 1837.

90,Lie of the Land,+ACI-Born in 1964, Brisbane+AC0-based Indigenous artist Fiona Foley studied in Sydney and at St Martin's School of Art in London. Collaborator Chris Knowles is a sound artist who has created many sound installations. Like Foley, Knowles is both an academic and practising artist. Lie of the Land comprises seven sandstone pillars standing some three metres high. Each pillar is inserted with a commodity that John Batman lists in his diary as an item he traded with Wurundjeri elders in 1835 to secure 600,000 acres of their land around Port Phillip Bay: 'blankets', 'knives', 'looking+AC0-glasses', 'tomahawks', 'beads', 'scissors' and 'flour'. Knowles' soundscape accompanies this compelling work, with Batman's entry on the controversial exchange read out in Woi wurrung +AC0- the local indigenous language +AC0- and several other languages representing the ethnic groups present in Australia around the time of settlement. The etched pillars are a powerful symbols+ADs- tombstone+AC0-like, they speak the fate of many Indigenous people through the process of settlement and colonisation. Placed near the Melbourne Museum, this sculpture also speaks eloquently of the relationship this institution once had with Indigenous peoples, collecting often+AC0-sacred items and relics, and at times by innapropriate means. In relation to the historical and political nature of this work, Fiona Foley has stated, 'As the history has been written by the victors, it is only now that the silent histories of the Indigenous populations are given a voice'. Lie of the Land was commissioned by the City of Melbourne to coincide with the Australian Reconciliation Convention, held in Melbourne in May 1997, and the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, which gave Indigenous Australians the right to vote. The sculpture was originally sited outside the Town Hall on Bourke Street and was later moved to a forecourt of Melbourne Museum. +ACI-,+ACI-Lie of the Land is a sculpture with a sound installation that hauntingly tells the story of the effect of colonisation on the Indigenous people in Australia, and around the world. +ACI-,,,Building+ADs- Contemporary Art+ADs- Memorial,Art Display+ADs- Memorial,,,Entertainment,20th century,Woi Wurrung,Wurundjeri,Kulin Nation,+ACI-Ray Thomas, Megan Evans and Robert Mate Mate c. 1994, Another View Walking Trail: Pathway of the Rainbow Serpent,City of Melbourne, Melbourne. +ACI-,Pamphlet/Brochure,,,Fiona Foley,Female,Chris Knowles,,St. Martin's School of Art+ADs- Melbourne Museum+ADs- City of Melbourne,,,None Recorded,None Recoded,Melbourne Museum,Memorial+ADs- Intangible Associations+ADs- Structure+ADs- Artwork,Melbourne Museum,+AC0-37.803646,44.9729424
